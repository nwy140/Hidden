Analysis 4
Unlike any other industry, the IT industry is full of dropout and people without degrees.
There's a bunch of self taught programmers out there who are better than people with degrees,
who have better portfolio than people degrees. 
You see the reason why so many self taught programmers are drop outs because we are really disapointed with the courses to the field we are
interested in because we learnt a lot more on our own programming and development than in academic courses.
We feel like they are limiting our skills and abilities with academics when could be there out there working and building some real applications rather than 
learning all these programming theories that we already know without building any real world applications.

So my advice to those who wants to get in the IT industry, 
don't limit yourself with academics, 
learn how to make applications , build and work on your own applications. 
There's a huge difference with between CS graduates who never made their own softwares before and a self taught programmers with a portfolio of apps.
People without portfolio will have trouble getting jobs and will always limit themselves, people with really world experience, skills and portfolios wont have any trouble getting a job or being self employed.
